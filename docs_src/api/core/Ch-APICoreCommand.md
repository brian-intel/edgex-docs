## Introduction

EdgeX Foundry's Command microservice is a conduit for other services to
trigger action on devices and sensors through their managing Device
Services. The service provides an API to get the list of commands that
can be issued for all devices or a single device. Commands are divided
into two groups for each device:

-   GET commands are issued to a device or sensor to get a current value
    for a particular attribute on the device, such as the current
    temperature provided by a thermostat sensor, or the on/off status of
    a light.
-   PUT commands are issued to a device or sensor to change the current
    state or status of a device or one of its attributes, such as
    setting the speed in RPMs of a motor, or setting the brightness of a
    dimmer light.
