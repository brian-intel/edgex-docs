## Introduction

EdgeX Foundry Core Data Service includes the device and sensor collected
data database and APIs to expose the database to other services as well
as north-bound integration. The database is secure. Direct access to the
database is restricted to the Core Data service APIs. Core Data also
provides the REST API to create and register a new device.
